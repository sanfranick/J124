# Players to keep an eye on in Fantasy Football 2023
## Story Summary
2022 was an alectric year for fantasy football- if you were a winner. Regardless of whether you won or lost, it's time to get ready for another competitive season. Analyzing data from Stathead Football (Pro Football Reference's main database), I identified several players who could make an impact in on the field, while simeultaneously making an impact on your fantasy team. Most people who play fantasy football know the difference between standard and PPR format (points per reception) leagues, but the media tends to only write articles ranking the best NFL players based on standard-format scoring. Due to this, people aren't aware of those NFL players who have a big change in their value depending on which scoring format is being used.

## Sourcing
https://stathead.com/tiny/RwGZZ

Stathead Football is the main databased for sports statistics used by many sports agencies, so I got my data from here. I filtered my search to only have stats from 2022, and to show the main fantasy football positions, QB (quarterback), RB (running back), WR (wide receiver), and TE (tight end). The dataset I downloaded from Stathead Football looked at stats from the top 100 fantasy scoring NFL players during the 2022 season. This dataset had all 100 players ranked 1-100 based on how many fantasy points they had total the prior season. It's important to note that this ranking was based on a standard-format league, rather than a PPR (points per reception) format league.

### As you continue, keep in mind that the top standard-format scoring NFL players are usually the only data Fantasy Footballers get their hands on regardless of which format they play.
 Here is a list of those top standard-format scoring fantasy football NFL players from the previous season that most fantasy footballers see

## Question 1
#### Who are the 5 most players in PPR format fantasy football heading into 2023?
To answer this question, I had to create a pivot table to look at each player's scoring in PPR-formats rather than standard-format. Then, I took into account players who maybe didn't play every game by filtering by PPG (points per game).

*  then removed those players that scored <200 points since anything less than 200 would imply they only played a handful of games. I did this to remove any "one hit wonders" that might've occured.

## Question 2

#### Which NFL players had their ranking dramatically improved when scoring format was moved to PPR?
To answer this question, I created a pivot table to look at each player's scoring in PPR-formats. I also removed any player who scored less than 200 points to remove anyone who maybe just had one good game. These steps were identical to the last problem so far.

* From here, I removed anyone whose previous standard-format rank was between 1-10 as these players are already ranked high. I then made a new pivot table with the remaining data.
